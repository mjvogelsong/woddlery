*By: Michael Vogelsong*

In an ideal world, what would be the best way to access, use, and build upon the world's collection of information and services? There's a lot of useful data, ideas, and functionality on the internet, but it's all scattered, inconsistent, and follows a million different conventions, which makes it harder to use and build upon. So, the goal of Woddle is to figure out the most intuitive interface to the internet for builders and creators. The practical approach is actually pretty simple: let people ask for what they want! On Woddle.io, people (developers are the initial audience) ask for small pieces of functionality they want to see ("request a Woddle"), and then a marketplace of builders implements the most in-demand APIs to fulfill those "Woddle" requests. By delegating implementation details to the domain experts, you can focus more on how to frame questions and less on technical details (like specific databases / protocols / models / etc.). This lowers the barrier to create new research, ideas, services, and businesses - which, in turn, enables more woddles, further fueling the cycle.

There are a few aspects to emphasize: first, when you are requesting a "Woddle," we encourage you to think in terms of what you want to accomplish, rather than what an isolated product, database, or company you think the woddle might match. This frames the question in a way that's a better proxy for what you really want. Second, while many developers commonly view APIs as a layer over a database, there are so many more interface options - generative models, functions, classifiers, input/output transforms, and many more. In other words, the woddles can and should ask for interfaces well beyond a database abstraction. The key is to think, "what could I do if I had the world's information *and* functionality at my fingertips?"

## What does success look like?

We'd love to see a community where building and creating is more broadly accessible. Our system would reduce the time and effort between having an idea or goal, and having a system that makes that idea or goal a reality.

## Why is it called "Woddle"?

There are two reasons:

(A) Everyone woddles before they learn to run. And on Woddle.io, you woddle before you run an API.
(B) I like penguins, and penguins are good at woddlin'.

# What do developers want?

At first, developers are our main audience. Developers are bpth users and builders, oftentimes benefitting from both sides of the marketplace. I don't know exactly what all developers value -- that's why Woddle exists! However, I think there are some key themes that will be true pretty often:

## From a user perspective

1. I want to work with the simplest interface possible that completely addresses my goals, but no simpler. There should be sensible, best-practice defaults whenever possible, with optional escape hatches when customization is needed.

2. I want to specify the most fundamental pieces of information, and then let the system infer the rest. I want the system to naturally encourage D.R.Y. (Don't Rewrite Yourself) practices.

3. I want to feel confident *using* a system -- knowing that it will perform reliably, efficiently, and accurately. I like when it "just works."

4. I want to feel confident *improving* a system, and have a low barrier to making those improvements. I should feel comfortable experimenting and trying new things, knowing that if I make a mistake or introduce an error, the remedy is straightforward. And I want to be able to piece services together easily.

5. Stateful worklfows can be confusing, so I'd like as little statefulness as possible. But when it is necessary, I should know where I'm at in a workflow, what to expect in proceeding, and how to return to an earlier or cleaner state.

6. I want pricing options that accurately reflect the value I'm receiving.

7. I want to know the services are trustworthy and employ good business ethics. I want to know my data is handled responsibly and transparently.

8. I want encapsulation with accountability. When working with inputs and outputs, I shouldn't have to know the technical inner workings of an API. However, I do want to be able to look under the hood of the API to: (a) learn and (b) hold the API provider acocuntable for good practices.

9. I want to feel like my feedback and concerns are genuinely heard and addressed.

## From a builder perspective

1. I want as little overhead as possible between having functionality (e.g., code) and deploying that functionality for community usage (i.e., as an API).

2. I want to earn money on my service proportional to the value I'm providing.

3. I want to feel comfortable upgrading my service, with confidence that the right changes will be available to my users.

4. I want to get my services in front of as many users as possible in my relevant audience.

5. I want to have the best information on what developers want, what frustrations they have, and what major needs are not currently being met.

6. I want to make sure my services are being used ethically.

As more users and builders join Woddle, I hope to update this summary with feedback! We will use these core needs to prioritize how we build and improve Woddle.io.
