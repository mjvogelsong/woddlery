*By: Michael Vogelsong*

In an ideal world, what would be the best way to use and build upon the world's collection of information and services? There's no shortage of useful data, ideas, and functionality on the internet; but it's not always easy or obvious how to build on top of it. So, our goal is to **figure out the most productive and intuitive interface to the internet for builders and creators**.

The practical approach is actually pretty simple: let users ask for what they want! On Woddle.io, developers ask for small pieces of functionality they want to see ("request a Woddle"), and then a marketplace of builders implements the most in-demand APIs to fulfill those "Woddle" requests. By delegating implementation details to the domain experts, you can focus more on how to frame questions and less on technical details (like specific databases / protocols / models / etc.). This lowers the barrier to create new research, ideas, services, and businesses - which, in turn, enables more woddles, fueling the cycle.

There are a few aspects we emphasize to users: first, we encourage you to think in terms of what you want to accomplish, rather than an isolated product, database, or company you think the woddle might match. Second, many developers commonly view APIs as an abstraction layer over a database. But there are so many interface options out there: generative models, functions, classifiers, input/output transforms, and more. In other words, we should ask for interfaces well beyond a database abstraction. The key question is, "what could I do if I had the world's information and functionality at my fingertips?"

# What does success look like?

We'd love to see a community where building and creating is more broadly accessible. Our system would reduce the time and effort between having an idea or goal, and having a system that makes it a reality.


# Why is it called "Woddle"?

Two reasons:

(A) Everyone woddles before they learn to run. And on Woddle.io, you woddle before you run an API.
(B) I like penguins, and penguins are good at woddlin'.
