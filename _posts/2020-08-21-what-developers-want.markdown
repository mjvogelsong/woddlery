Developers are both users and builders, often benefitting from both sides of the marketplace. I don't know exactly what all developers value -- that's why Woddle exists! However, I think there are some key themes:

# From a user perspective

1. I want to work with the simplest interface possible that completely addresses my goals, but no simpler. There should be sensible, best-practice defaults whenever possible, with optional escape hatches when customization is needed.

2. I want to specify the most fundamental pieces of information, and then let the system infer the rest. I want the system to naturally encourage D.R.Y. (Don't Rewrite Yourself) practices.

3. If I'm requesting an interface, I want to have confidence that either (a) there's already an implemented API on the platform, or (b) a high-quality API will be implemented soon.

4. I want to feel confident *using* a system -- knowing that it will perform reliably, efficiently, and accurately. I like when it "just works."

5. I want to feel confident *improving* a system. I should feel comfortable experimenting and trying new things, knowing that if I make a mistake or introduce an error, the remedy is straightforward. And I want to be able to plug services together easily.

6. Stateful workflows can be confusing, so I'd like as little statefulness as possible. But when it is necessary, I should know where I'm at in a workflow, what to expect in proceeding, and how to return to an earlier or cleaner state.

7. I want good pricing options that accurately reflect the value I'm receiving.

8. I want to know the services are trustworthy and employ good business ethics. I want to know my data is handled responsibly and transparently.

9. I want encapsulation with accountability. When working with inputs and outputs, I shouldn't have to know the technical inner workings of an API. However, I do want to be able to look under the hood of the API to: (a) learn and (b) hold the API provider accountable for good practices.

10. I want to feel like my feedback and concerns are genuinely heard and addressed.

# From a builder perspective

1. I want as little overhead as possible between having functionality (e.g., code) and deploying that functionality for community usage (i.e., as an API).

2. I want to earn money on my service.

3. I want to feel comfortable upgrading my service, with confidence that the right changes will be available to my users.

4. I want to get my services in front of as many relevant users as possible. I want to know people will use it.

5. I want the best insight into what developers want, what frustrations they have, and what major needs are not currently being met.

6. I want to make sure my services are being used ethically.

As more users and builders join Woddle, I hope to update this summary with feedback! We will use these core needs to prioritize how we build and improve Woddle.io.
